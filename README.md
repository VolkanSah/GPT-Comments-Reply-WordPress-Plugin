## Description

Comments Reply with GPT(OpenAi) is a plugin that uses OpenAI's GPT to automatically reply to comments on your WordPress website. The plugin adds a "Reply with WPWM OpenAI" button to the comment line actions, which when clicked, sends the comment text to OpenAI's ChatGPT API and returns a suggested response.
